# Scaffold Addendum: Chapter 1 -- Proof of Life

This addendum adds the Figure Plan that was missing from the original Ch01
production (which predated the figure conventions). Ch01 is a Setup chapter,
so the target is 1-2 figures.

## Figure Plan

| # | Description | Type | Source command | Chapter location |
