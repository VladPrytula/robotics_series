"""
Lab modules for pedagogical from-scratch implementations.

These modules show how RL equations map to code. They are:
- Pedagogical: explicit operations, clear naming
- Not for production: use scripts/chNN_*.py for experiments
- Snippet sources: tutorials include labeled regions via pymdownx.snippets
